PowerDNS Recursor
-----------------
For full details, please read https://doc.powerdns.com/md/recursor/

Here follow some brief notes that may be useful to get you going.

Compiling
---------
Starting with version 4.0.0, the PowerDNS recursor uses autotools and compiling
from the tarball can be as simple as

```
$ ./configure
$ make
```

As for dependencies, Boost (http://boost.org/) and OpenSSL (https://openssl.org/)
are required.

On most modern UNIX distributions, you can simply install 'boost' or
'boost-dev' or 'boost-devel'. Otherwise, just download boost, and point the
compiler at the right directory using CPPFLAGS.

On Debian and Ubuntu, the following will get you the dependencies:

```
$ apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-serialization-dev libssl-dev g++ make pkg-config
```

Compiling from git checkout
===========================
Source code is available on GitHub:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns.git
```

This repository contains the sources for the PowerDNS Recursor, the PowerDNS
Authoritative Server, and dnsdist (a powerful DNS loadbalancer). The sources for
the recursor are located in the `pdns/recursordist` subdirectory of the repository.

To compile from a git checkout, install pandoc, ragel, automake and autoconf.
Then run

```
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
```

Lua scripting
-------------
To benefit from Lua scripting, as described on https://doc.powerdns.com/md/recursor/scripting/
Install Lua and development headers. PowerDNS supports Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and LuaJIT.
On Debian/Ubuntu, install e.g. `liblua-5.2-dev` to use Lua 5.2.

The configure script will automatically detect the Lua version. If more than one
version of Lua is installed, the `--with-lua` configure flag can be set to the
desired version. e.g.:

```
$ ./configure --with-lua=lua51
```

Documentation
-------------
After compiling, run `pdns_recursor --config` to view the configuration options
and a short description. The full documentation is online at
https://doc.powerdns.com/md/recursor/

Reporting bugs
--------------
Bugs can be reported on GitHub: https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues, please
